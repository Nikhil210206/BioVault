BIOVAULT SECURITY & PRIVACY DOCUMENTATION
================================================================================

Version: 1.0
Last Updated: January 2025
Document Purpose: Technical security and privacy documentation for BioVault

================================================================================
1. SECURITY ARCHITECTURE
================================================================================

1.1 Encryption Standards
-------------------------
- Data at Rest: AES-256-GCM (Galois/Counter Mode)
- Data in Transit: TLS 1.3 with perfect forward secrecy
- Key Derivation: PBKDF2-SHA256 with 100,000 iterations
- Password Hashing: Argon2id (recommended) or bcrypt

1.2 Biometric Data Processing
------------------------------
- CLIENT-SIDE PROCESSING: Face alignment, cropping, and feature extraction
  performed locally on user's device using JavaScript/WebAssembly

- EMBEDDING GENERATION: Mathematical representation of biometric features
  created client-side. Original images/audio NOT sent to server by default.

- ENCRYPTION BEFORE TRANSMISSION: Embeddings encrypted with user's master
  key before leaving the device.

- SERVER STORAGE: Only encrypted embeddings stored. Original raw biometric
  data (images, audio) is NOT stored unless user explicitly opts-in with
  informed consent.

1.3 Zero-Knowledge Architecture
--------------------------------
BioVault implements a zero-knowledge architecture where:

- Server cannot decrypt user's biometric embeddings without user's master key
- Master key is derived from user's password + biometric proof
- Server stores only:
  * Encrypted biometric embeddings
  * Encrypted password vault entries
  * Metadata (timestamps, device info, encrypted)
  * Session tokens (temporary, revocable)

1.4 Authentication Flow
------------------------
ENROLLMENT:
  1. User captures face/voice locally
  2. Client extracts features and generates embedding (local processing)
  3. Embedding encrypted with user's master key
  4. Encrypted embedding sent to server over TLS
  5. Server stores encrypted embedding + metadata
  6. Original capture deleted from client memory

UNLOCK:
  1. User presents biometric (face/voice)
  2. Client generates embedding from live capture
  3. Client requests encrypted stored embedding from server
  4. Client decrypts stored embedding locally
  5. Client performs similarity match (local)
  6. If match score > threshold (80%), generate unlock token
  7. Token sent to server for session creation

================================================================================
2. DATA STORAGE & RETENTION
================================================================================

2.1 What We Store (Default Settings)
-------------------------------------
✓ Encrypted biometric embeddings (128-512 dimensional vectors)
✓ Enrollment timestamps (ISO 8601 format, UTC)
✓ Device metadata (user agent, IP address hash)
✓ Session logs (login/logout times, authentication method)
✓ Encrypted vault entries (passwords, notes)
✓ User account info (name, email, username - all encrypted)

2.2 What We DO NOT Store (Default Settings)
--------------------------------------------
✗ Raw face images or photographs
✗ Raw audio recordings or voice samples
✗ Plaintext passwords or sensitive data
✗ Unencrypted user information
✗ Biometric templates without user consent

2.3 Optional Raw Data Storage
------------------------------
Users can enable "Store Raw Biometric Data" in Settings:

- Requires explicit, informed consent (checkbox + confirmation dialog)
- Consent timestamp and IP address logged
- Raw images/audio encrypted with separate key
- User can view what raw data is stored
- User can delete raw data at any time
- Raw data retention: 90 days (configurable, min 30 days)

CONSENT FLOW:
  1. User toggles "Save Raw Biometric Data" in Settings
  2. Warning dialog explains risks and implications
  3. User must type confirmation phrase: "I CONSENT TO STORING RAW DATA"
  4. Consent timestamp recorded in audit log
  5. Raw data storage enabled (can be revoked anytime)

2.4 Data Retention Periods
---------------------------
- Encrypted Embeddings: Retained while account active
- Session Logs: 90 days (rolling window)
- Audit Logs: 1 year (compliance requirement)
- Deleted Account Data: 30-day soft delete, then permanent deletion
- Raw Biometric Data (if opted-in): 90 days, then auto-deleted

2.5 Data Deletion
------------------
Users can permanently delete:
- All biometric data (face, voice, or both)
- Individual authentication methods
- Entire account (including all associated data)

SECURE DELETION PROCESS:
  1. User requests deletion from Settings page
  2. Confirmation code required: "DELETE-ALL-BIOMETRICS"
  3. Data marked for deletion in database
  4. Background job performs cryptographic erasure
  5. Deletion confirmation sent to user's email
  6. Audit log entry created (anonymized)
  7. Data recovery impossible after 30 days

================================================================================
3. PRIVACY CONTROLS
================================================================================

3.1 User Privacy Rights (GDPR/CCPA Compliant)
----------------------------------------------
- Right to Access: Download all stored data in JSON format
- Right to Deletion: Permanently delete account and all data
- Right to Portability: Export encrypted vault data
- Right to Rectification: Update or correct stored information
- Right to Object: Opt-out of optional data collection
- Right to Restrict: Limit data processing to essential operations

3.2 VPN-Only Unlock Mode
-------------------------
Advanced security feature for high-risk users:

- When enabled, vault unlock requires verified VPN connection
- Server checks for VPN indicators:
  * IP address belongs to known VPN providers
  * DNS leak tests
  * WebRTC leak checks
- Unlock request denied if VPN not detected
- User notified of failed VPN verification

IMPLEMENTATION:
  Backend verifies:
  - User's IP against VPN provider databases
  - DNS resolution consistency
  - GeoIP location anomalies
  - Known VPN IP ranges

3.3 Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
------------------------------------
Optional additional security layer:

- TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) support
- Backup codes for account recovery
- Biometric + OTP required for unlock
- 2FA can be enforced org-wide (enterprise feature)

3.4 Privacy-Preserving Analytics
---------------------------------
BioVault collects minimal, anonymized telemetry:

- Authentication success/failure rates (aggregated)
- Feature usage statistics (no PII)
- Performance metrics (load times, error rates)
- Device/browser compatibility data

ALL analytics are:
- Opt-out available in Settings
- Anonymized (no user identification)
- Aggregated (no individual tracking)
- Minimal (only essential for service improvement)

================================================================================
4. THREAT MODEL & MITIGATIONS
================================================================================

4.1 Identified Threats
-----------------------
1. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack
   - Mitigation: TLS 1.3 with certificate pinning
   - Mitigation: HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) enabled

2. Replay Attack
   - Mitigation: Nonce-based authentication
   - Mitigation: Short-lived session tokens (1 hour expiry)
   - Mitigation: Timestamp verification (±5 minute window)

3. Biometric Spoofing (Presentation Attack)
   - Mitigation: Liveness detection (client-side)
   - Mitigation: Challenge-response protocol
   - Mitigation: Multi-modal authentication (face + voice)

4. Credential Stuffing
   - Mitigation: Rate limiting (20 attempts/hour)
   - Mitigation: Account lockout after 5 failed attempts
   - Mitigation: IP-based throttling

5. Database Breach
   - Mitigation: All sensitive data encrypted at rest
   - Mitigation: Separate encryption keys per user
   - Mitigation: Master keys never stored on server
   - Mitigation: Compromised embeddings useless without decryption key

6. Insider Threat
   - Mitigation: Zero-knowledge architecture
   - Mitigation: Audit logs (immutable, timestamped)
   - Mitigation: Multi-signature access controls
   - Mitigation: Principle of least privilege

4.2 Security Boundaries
------------------------
CLIENT TRUST BOUNDARY:
  - User's device is considered trusted
  - Biometric processing happens client-side
  - Master keys never leave client device
  - Client responsible for secure key storage

SERVER TRUST BOUNDARY:
  - Server considered "honest but curious"
  - Server stores only encrypted data
  - Server cannot decrypt without user's cooperation
  - Server provides availability and integrity

NETWORK TRUST BOUNDARY:
  - Network considered untrusted/hostile
  - All communication encrypted with TLS 1.3
  - No sensitive data sent in URL parameters
  - CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
